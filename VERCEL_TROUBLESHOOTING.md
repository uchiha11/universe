# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Fixed Issues ✅
- Added MP4 and font file support to webpack
- Added CopyWebpackPlugin to copy public files
- Updated Vercel configuration for better asset handling

## Steps to Deploy Successfully

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix webpack config and add copy plugin"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Find your project
- Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment

### 3. Check Build Logs
If deployment fails:
- Click on the failed deployment
- Check the build logs for errors
- Common issues:
  - Large file size warnings (can be ignored)
  - Missing dependencies
  - Build command errors

### 4. Domain Configuration
For www.theu1niverse.com:

**In Vercel:**
- Settings → Domains
- Add: `theu1niverse.com`
- Add: `www.theu1niverse.com`

**In GoDaddy DNS:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.19

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### 5. Test Your Site
After deployment, test:
- Video loads: `/u.mp4`
- Images load: `/heroText.png`, `/universe.jpg`
- Fonts load: `/fonts/suisse-intl-600.woff2`

## Current Status
✅ Build working locally
✅ All assets copying to dist folder
✅ Webpack configured for all file types
✅ Vercel config updated

Your site should now deploy successfully!
