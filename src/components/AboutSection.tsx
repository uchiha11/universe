            U1NIVERSE is the global creative space of Yuvan Shankar Raja — composer, singer, performer, and one of India’s most influential musical voices. Built on a journey that has redefined soundtracks and live music experiences for over two decades, U1NIVERSE is where Yuvan’s music, artistry, and community come together without boundaries.

More than just concerts, U1NIVERSE is a celebration of stories, emotions, and cultures through music. From chart-topping film compositions to independent singles, and from intimate unplugged sessions to massive world tours, every project under U1NIVERSE reflects Yuvan’s belief that music is not just heard, but felt.

Driven by passion and powered by fans across the world, U1NIVERSE is also a platform for collaborations — bringing together artists, genres, and generations on one stage. It is about creating timeless experiences, connecting people across continents, and building a living legacy that grows louder with every beat.

Step into the U1NIVERSE — where music becomes an emotion, and every performance is a moment that belongs to all.
